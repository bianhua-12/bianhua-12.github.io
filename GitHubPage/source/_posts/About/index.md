# About

I am currently conducting research at Zhongguancun Academy, supervised by [Chao Yu](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/ChaoYu).

My research focuses on reinforcement learning for VLA (Vision-Language-Action) models.

I am a PhD student in the DT Group at SCIR-DT, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), supervised by [Prof. Wei-Nan Zhang](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhangweinan).
